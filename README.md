Computer Architecture Lab Description 
=====================================
Instructor: Prof. Yale Patt

The course mainly talks about characteristics of instruction set architecture and microarchitecture; physical and virtual memory; caches and cache design; interrupts and exceptions; integer and floating-point arithmetic; I/O processing; buses; pipelining, out-of-order execution, branch prediction, and other performance enhancements; design trade-offs; case studies of commercial microprocessors. 

Laboratory work includes completing the behavioral-level design of a microarchitecture (LC-3b). The following is how these labs work.

Lab1 Write an assembler for the LC-3b Assembly Language
-------------------------------------------------------
The LC-3b supports a rich, but lean, instruction set. Each 16-bit instruction consists of an opcode (bits[15:12]) plus 12 additional bits to specify the other information which is needed to carry out the work of that instruction. Figure A summarizes the 14 different opcodes in the LC-3b and the specification of the remaining bits of each instruction. The 15th and 16th 4-bit opcodes are not specified, but are reserved for future use. Figure B shows the entire LC-3b instruction set.

The task of the assembler is that of line-by-line translation. The input is an assembly language file, and the output is an object (ISA) file (consisting of hexadecimal digits). To make it a little more concrete, here is a sample assembly language program:
    ;This program counts from 10 to 0 .ORIG x3000
          LEA R0, TEN       ;This instruction will be loaded into memory location x3000
          LDW R1, R0, #0
    START ADDR1,R1,#­1
          BRZ DONE 
          BR START
                            ;blank line
    DONE  TRAP x25          ;The last executable instruction
    TEN   .FILL x000A       ;This is 10 in 2's comp, hexadecimal
          .END              ;The pseudo­op, delimiting the source program

And its corresponding ISA program:
    0x3000
    0xE005
    0x6200
    0x127F 
    0x0401 
    0x0FFD 
    0xF025 
    0x000A
